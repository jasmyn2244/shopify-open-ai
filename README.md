# AI Assistant

[Deploy Link](https://shopify-open-ai.herokuapp.com/)
Disclaimer: it seems that openAI is not compatible with deployment. On my local device, the app works without bugs, but on Heroku, you can't submit a promt without an error.

## Abstract

AI Assitant allows users to interact with artificial intelligence. When the user makes requests using standard human language, the api will process the request/promp and return an answer similar to what we would expect from a human (and often better!).

## Project Goals

- Build a beautiful and simple application that is well tested, accessible, and easy to use.
